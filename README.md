# Kernel Vulnerability Measurement Project
This repository provides kernel vulnerability  measurement research source code and dataset of CSS2023.

Source code and dataset will be available at the same time of the paper publication for the conference. 
- Hiroki Kuzuno, Tomohiko Yano, Kazuki Omo, and Toshihiro Yamauchi, "Investigation of Software Patch for Linux Kernel Vulnerability", Computer Security Symposium 2023 (CSS2023), Oct, 2023. Japan.

## Source code
It contains four source files that analyze the CVE dataset of NVD and Linux kernel repository.
These extract software patches and source code files before and after vulnerability fixing.
After that, these calculate the statistics of software patches for CVE/CWE, and NCD similarity of source code files.

## Dataset
Dataset contains following information.

For each year, 2002 to 2023.07
- Statistics of commit hit and no hit of CVE

For each CVE with commit id
- Software patches
- Source code files before and after vulnerability fixes
- NCD similarity of source code files
- Statistics and information of commit

Dataset providing
- Please contact us for the dataset sharing.
